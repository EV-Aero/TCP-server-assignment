# TCP-server-assignment
Rewrote some of he code from previous and moved it to be handled on
serverside instead of client side.

Currently the program are able to:
	- Register new user
	- Check if username is taken
	- Check if username and password is correct
	- Send files with the extension of .jpg and .txt

The code for this can be found in the two TCPPython folders, Server
and client has to be ran in two different CLIs or IDEs
